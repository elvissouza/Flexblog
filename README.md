It has a responsive design, based on the studies of the **Origamid-Flexbox** course, trying to add the least number of  
*media Queries* possible, there are also some basic interactions like “click”, etc.  
Project based on studies and functional tests. No goal in being commercial or professional. 
**OBS:** ```flex: 2 1 260px;```avoid bugs in old browsers / Safari
